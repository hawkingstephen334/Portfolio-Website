                    <p>The JavaScript reference serves as a repository of facts about the JavaScript language. The

                    <p>The JavaScript language is intended to be used within some larger environment, be it a browser,

                <h2>JavaScript & Java</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language(“scripting language”) and is used to make web
                        pages interactive. It can insert dynamic text into HTML. JavaScript is also known as the
                        browser’s language. JavaScript(JS) is not similar or related to Java. Both the languages have a
                        C-like syntax and are widely used in client-side and server-side Web applications, but there are
                        few similarities only.</p>
                    <p>Features of Javascript are as follows: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>JavaScript was created in the first place for DOM manipulation. Earlier websites were mostly
                            static, after JS was created dynamic Web sites were made.</li>
                        <li>Functions in JS are objects. They may have properties and methods just like another object.
                            They can be passed as arguments in other functions.</li>
                        <li>Performs Form Validation although the forms are created using HTML.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example: This is the basic Javascript example. </p>
                    <code>
                        console.log("Welcome to GeeksforGeeks Learning");
                        
                    </code>

                    <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language and has a virtual machine platform that allows
                        you to create compiled programs that run on nearly every platform. Java promised, “Write Once,
                        Run Anywhere”.
                    </p>
                    <p>Features of Java are as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="serial">
                        <li>1. Platform Independent: The compiler converts source code to bytecode and then the JVM
                            executes the bytecode generated by the compiler. This bytecode can run on any platform.</li>
                        <li>2. Object-Oriented Programming Language: Organizing the program in the terms of collection
                            of objects is a way of object-oriented programming, each of which represents an instance of
                            the class.</li>
